Tools for working with the Emotiv Epoc EEG headset


#How to Reformat files saved from Test Bench (into an actual data format):

1. You'll put copies (do not use the original files, but you know that) into the "Input" folder.
2. You'll open terminal and get to the folder containing the python script "CSVFormatter.py"
3. Type "python CSVFormatter.py"
4. Wait a while (it will tell you each time it finishes a file and out of how many are left).

The newly formatted files will be in the Output folder, along with a separate folder called "Info" which will have little bits of info for each subject.

I'm happy to develop more tools as you see fit. Email requests to joshua.e.zosky@gmail.com
